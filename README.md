Client/Server Development
# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Simply making sure you’re your project and solutions are properly documented and allocated can save you a lot of issues. Also making sure your environment is properly setup can save a lot of time with configuration issues. Taking the time to develop readable code including notes will also help. 
# What were the advantages of working in this way? 
Working in this matter I was able to separate and test my code properly. I really liked the cleanliness of CRUD and the simplicity. This is something I would definitely consider using when dealing with databases and large amounts of data. 
# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? 
Any issues I face I search google, watch videos, and visit the website of any framework I’m using. For example, I used plotly because I was using the DASH framework to build my data tables and charts and filtering.
# How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 
With this project I had to really grasp an understanding of the framework.
# What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 
I would make sure to select a database type that best fits the clients needs.
# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. And because computers solve problems to serve and enrich people, there is a significant human component to computer science.
# How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? 
I would provide them with the tools needed as requested and go above and beyond to make sure its user friendly.
